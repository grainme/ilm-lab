> Pub/Sub systems are the opposite of point-to-point systems. In point-to-point systems, the sender is painfully aware of the receiver. For example, an HTTP request is point-to-point. The client sends a request directly to the server, and the server sends a response directly back to the client.

> Pub/Sub systems are often used to enable "event-driven design", or "event-driven architecture". An event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled systems.

Some applications use a "microservices" architecture rather than a "monolithic" one. That just means that the backend of their application has been broken up into many smaller applications that talk to each other.
